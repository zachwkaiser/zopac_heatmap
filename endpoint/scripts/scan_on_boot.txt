This is the layout of a configuration file that will be on every endpoint. The purpose is to tell the Pi what to run automatically on boot.
It will use a .service extension

<<Begin code>>

[Unit]
Description=Wi-Fi Endpoint Capture Service
After=network.target

[Service]
# If you keep WorkingDirectory, ensure it exists:
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/WiFi_Project

# Run monitor setup first
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/bash /home/pi/WiFi_Project/setup_monitor.sh wlan1

# Start capture pipeline
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /home/pi/WiFi_Project/capture_wifi.sh wlan1 /home/pi/logs

# Good hygiene
User=pi
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

<<End code>>

To create the .service File:
1. Open CLI
2. navigate to root
3. navigate to the system directory using:
    cd etc/systemd/system
4. create the .system file using:
    sudo nano wifi-capture.service (NOTE: This name can be anything; its just the title of the service being created)
5. Type all of the code above and save
6. After saving and exiting, run the following commands:
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart wifi-capture.service
    systemctl status wifi-capture.service
7. The .sh scripts within the project are now running on boot

Key Notes:
a. This service file calls both the setup_monitor.sh and capture_wifi.sh files in this order. So, anything other files (.sh, .json, .py, etc) that are involved with these scripts will consequently execute
b. All logs are written to /home/pi instead of the dedicated WiFi_Project directory. Im doing this in attempt to keep the Projected Directory clean of constant log files- I want it to be purely code

c. HIGH IMPORTANCE: To terminate the scanning process initiated by the .service file, run the following command after booting the system:
    sudo systemctl stop wifi-capture.service

Confirm the service was terminated using:
    sudo systemctl status wifi-capture.service

Look for a line containing: wifi-capture.service: Deactivated successfully
This will suspend the program during this session and it will resume on the next boot. 

d. Recently created: wifi_status.py! This script will display the current information of the .service function.

e. MAKE SURE ALL FILES USE LF LINE SEQUENCE. This has caused more trouble on the Pi's than it should have. 

Any further questions and or troubleshooting will have to be resolve with the internet/AI.
