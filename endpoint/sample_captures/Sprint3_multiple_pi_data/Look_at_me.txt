I spent a solid 12 hours trying to get these things to scan in unison and they refuse.

Data goes missing on EP2 and the log file is somehow protected and doesn't allow me to move/
edit it on EP4. 

I think the culprit is the .service file I made to start a scan at a designated UTC time, but 
I need to look into it some more to be certain.

I need to just nuke the whole timed start concept, or at least how I have it set up now. Next 
steps should be to just use the server to try and sync them all up and start a scan at the 
same time...... that honestly sounds worse
